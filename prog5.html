            <h1> Holi</h1>
            <p >Holi is a sacred ancient tradition of Hindus, a holiday in many states of India with regional holidays in
                other countries. It is a cultural celebration that gives Hindus and non-Hindus alike an opportunity to
                have fun and play with other people by throwing coloured water and powder at each other. It is also
                observed broadly on the Indian subcontinent. Holi is celebrated at the end of winter, on the last full
                moon day of the Hindu luni-solar calendar month, marking the spring, making the date vary with the lunar
                cycle.[note 1] The date falls typically in March, but sometimes late February of the Gregorian
                calendar.[31][32]

                The festival has many purposes; most prominently, it celebrates the beginning of spring. In 17th century
                literature, it was identified as a festival that celebrated agriculture, commemorated good spring
                harvests, and the fertile land.[16] Hindus believe it is a time to enjoying spring's abundant colors and
                say farewell to winter. To many Hindus, Holi festivities mark an occasion to reset and renew ruptured
                relationships, end conflicts, and rid themselves of accumulated emotional impurities from the
                past.[23][33]

                It also has a religious purpose, symbolically signified by the legend of Holika. The night before Holi,
                bonfires are lit in a ceremony known as Holika Dahan (burning of Holika) or Little Holi. People gather
                near fires, sing and dance. The next day, Holi, also known as Dhuli in Sanskrit, or Dhulheti, Dhulandi
                or Dhulendi, is celebrated.[34]

                In northern parts of India, children spray coloured powder solutions (gulal) at each other, laugh, and
                celebrate, while adults smear dry coloured powder (abir) on each other's faces.[5][33] Visitors to homes
                are first teased with colours, then served with Holi delicacies (such as gujhia, shakkarpaare, matri,
                and dahi vada), desserts and drinks.[35][36][37] After playing with colours, and cleaning up, people
                bathe, put on clean clothes, and visit friends and family.[23]</p>
